Status Updates
================

Every week you will present a status update in our weekly
meeting. Each update should have a couple of slides worth of
information. You should store the files for those updates in this directory.

You have (I believe) three reasonable choices for software to prepare
visuals for presentations:

* Powerpoint/Keynote
* LaTeX
* IPython

The ``git and github'' notebook in this directory is an example of the
last option. I'll add a sample LaTeX file (and update this file) at a
later time.
